# EmailBot
Email bot that I named Leonard after my cat. Says mean things about my spending habits :( 

At the moment he only screens my purchases on Aliexpress and comments on those.
He does this by being forwarded a copy of every email I get from Aliexpress. 
Might upgrade him later to condemn every purchase everywhere, but to do that I'd 
have to forward him my banking emails and I'm not sure if I want to do that.
Plus not all my purchases deserve to be commented on by my robot!  


He runs locally on my machine with a task scheduler attempting to run him every single minute! 
That way, I only have to wait a minute to be reminded of my poor spending habits!
